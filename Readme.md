## Developing

To set up your local dev environment, go to the `amplify-cli` directory and then run the following:<br>
`yarn config set workspaces-experimental true`<br>
`npm run setup-dev`

To test your category, do the following:<br>
`cd <your test front-end project>` <br>
`amplify-dev init` <br>
`amplify-dev <your category> <subcommand>`<br>

Before pushing code or sending a pull request, do the following:

- At the command line, run `npm run lint` at the top-level directory. This invokes lerna to check for lint errors in all of our packages.
- You can use `eslint` to fix some of the lint errors. To use it, go to the package that has errors and run `lint-fix`
- If there are any remaining lint errors, resolve them manually. Linting your code is a best practice that ensures good code quality so it's important that you don't skip this step.
