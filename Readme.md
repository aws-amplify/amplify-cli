## Developing

To set up your local development environment, go to [Local Environment Setup](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#local-environment-setup).

To test your category, do the following:

```sh
cd <your-test-front-end-project>
amplify-dev init
amplify-dev <your-category> <subcommand>
```

Before pushing code or sending a pull request, do the following:

- At the command line, run `yarn lint` at the top-level directory. This invokes eslint to check for lint errors in all of our packages.
- You can use `yarn lint` to find some of the lint errors. To attempt fix them, go to the package that has errors and run `yarn lint-fix`
- If there are any remaining lint errors, resolve them manually. Linting your code is a best practice that ensures good code quality so it's important that you don't skip this step.
