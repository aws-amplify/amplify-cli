### BREAKING CHANGES

* If an owner is used in the auth directive it will either be a requirement if it's
the only rule or an optional input if used with other rules
* If an owner is included in the auth directive it will either be a requirement if
it's the only rule or an optional input if used with other rules
* the subscription operations will require an argument if owner is the only auth rule
* Subscriptions will require an argument if an owner is only rule set - If owner &
group rules are owner will be an optional arg
