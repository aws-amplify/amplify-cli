### BREAKING CHANGES

- If an owner is used in the auth directive it will either be a requirement if it's
  the only rule or an optional input if used with other rules
- If an owner is included in the auth directive it will either be a requirement if
  it's the only rule or an optional input if used with other rules

- Subscriptions will require an argument if an owner is only rule set - If owner &
  group rules are owner will be an optional arg
