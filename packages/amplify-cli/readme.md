# AWS Amplify CLI

The AWS Amplify CLI is a toolchain which includes a robust feature set for simplifying mobile and web application development. The CLI uses AWS CloudFormation and nested stacks, which allows you to add or modify configurations locally and test them before you push them for execution in your account.

Amplify Mocking is intended for testing only, and should not be utilized for production workloads.
