 * In cdkV2 this function is not exported by the library. This function is copied from above to get previous behavior as an effort of
 * migrating amplify-cli from CDK V1 to CDK V2.
 *
 * Since we cant import it (method as private in cdkV2) and when removing this function result in undesired behavior where cfn
 * template for geo were missing dependsOn attributes causing deployment failures for those templates.
 *
 * This file should remain untouched and should not import any dependencies
 * Moving forward Geo category should utilize cdk.App object for template synthesis.
