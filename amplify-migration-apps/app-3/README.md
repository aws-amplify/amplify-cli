# Personal Media Vault - Amplify Gen1 Setup Guide

A personal media management application built with Amplify Gen1, featuring social authentication, GraphQL API, Lambda functions, S3 storage, and DynamoDB.

## Categories

### api
GraphQL API with schema containing UserProfile, MediaItem, Collection, SharedItem, and Note models with relationships. Uses Cognito User Pool for default auth with API key as additional auth type.

### auth
Cognito-based authentication using email/phone with social providers (Facebook, Google). Includes user groups: Admin and Basic (manually assigned).

### storage
- DynamoDB tables for UserProfile, MediaItem, Collection, SharedItem, and Note (auto-generated by @model directive)
- S3 bucket for authenticated users to create/update, read, and delete media files; guest users have read access

### function
Node.js Lambda function (thumbnailgen) for automatic thumbnail generation on S3 uploads.

## Description

This is a personal media vault with social authentication. Users can upload images, videos, and documents to S3, organize them in collections, and share with others. The app features real-time thumbnail processing via Lambda.

Users sign up with email/phone or social login (Facebook/Google). Media files are stored in S3 bucket with auth and guest read access. Thumbnail generation is handled via Lambda function triggered on upload. All data uses DynamoDB tables auto-generated by Amplify's @model directive. CRUD operations are via GraphQL with AWS AppSync. Auth is managed through Cognito with social providers. User groups (Admin/Basic) must be manually assigned.

Edit the file in your editor: amplify/backend/function/thumbnailgen/src/index.js
? Press enter to continue
```
In `amplify/backend/function/thumbnailgen/src/index.js`, replace with:

```javascript
const { S3Client, GetObjectCommand, PutObjectCommand } = require('@aws-sdk/client-s3');

const s3 = new S3Client({ region: process.env.AWS_REGION });

/**
 * @type {import('@types/aws-lambda').S3Handler}
 */
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    console.log(`EVENT: ${JSON.stringify(event)}`);

    for (const record of event.Records) {
        const bucket = record.s3.bucket.name;
        const key = decodeURIComponent(record.s3.object.key.replace(/\+/g, ' '));

        // Skip if already a thumbnail
        if (key.includes('/thumbnails/')) {
            continue;
        }

        // Only process image files
        if (!key.match(/\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|webp)$/i)) {
            continue;
        }

        try {
            // Get file metadata
            const getCommand = new GetObjectCommand({ Bucket: bucket, Key: key });
            const fileData = await s3.send(getCommand);
            
            console.log(`Processing image: ${key}`);
            console.log(`File size: ${fileData.ContentLength} bytes`);
            console.log(`Content type: ${fileData.ContentType}`);
            
            // Create a simple text file as "thumbnail" for now
            const thumbnailKey = key.replace(/^(.+)\/([^/]+)$/, '$1/thumbnails/$2') + '.txt';
            const thumbnailContent = `Thumbnail info for: ${key}\nSize: ${fileData.ContentLength} bytes\nType: ${fileData.ContentType}`;
            
            const putCommand = new PutObjectCommand({
                Bucket: bucket,
                Key: thumbnailKey,
                Body: thumbnailContent,
                ContentType: 'text/plain'
            });
            await s3.send(putCommand);
            
            console.log(`Thumbnail info created: ${thumbnailKey}`);
            
        } catch (error) {
            console.error(`Error processing ${key}:`, error);
        }
    }

    return { statusCode: 200, body: 'Thumbnails processed' };
};
```

  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:GetObject",
    "s3:PutObject"
  ],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*/*"
}
```
