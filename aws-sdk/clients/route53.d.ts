For example, you can use ChangeResourceRecordSets to create a resource record set that routes traffic for test.example.com to a web server that has an IP address of 192.0.2.44.  Change Batches and Transactional Changes  The request body must include a document with a ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest element. The request body contains a list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered transactional changes. When using the Amazon Route 53 API to change resource record sets, Amazon Route 53 either makes all or none of the changes in a change batch request. This ensures that Amazon Route 53 never partially implements the intended changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone.  For example, a change batch request that deletes the CNAME record for www.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. Amazon Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the second resource record set in a single operation. If either the DELETE or the CREATE action fails, then both changes (plus any other changes in the batch) fail, and the original CNAME record continues to exist.  Due to the nature of transactional changes, you can't delete the same resource record set more than once in a single change batch. If you attempt to delete the same change batch more than once, Amazon Route 53 returns an InvalidChangeBatch error.   Traffic Flow  To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use either the traffic flow visual editor in the Amazon Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a traffic policy, then associate the traffic policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back the updates if the new configuration isn't performing as expected. For more information, see Using Traffic Flow to Route DNS Traffic in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.  Create, Delete, and Upsert  Use ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest to perform the following actions:    CREATE: Creates a resource record set that has the specified values.    DELETE: Deletes an existing resource record set that has the specified values.    UPSERT: If a resource record set does not already exist, AWS creates it. If a resource set does exist, Amazon Route 53 updates it with the values in the request.     Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting Resource Record Sets  The syntax for a request depends on the type of resource record set that you want to create, delete, or update, such as weighted, alias, or failover. The XML elements in your request must appear in the order listed in the syntax.  For an example for each type of resource record set, see "Examples." Don't refer to the syntax in the "Parameter Syntax" section, which includes all of the elements for every kind of resource record set that you can create, delete, or update by using ChangeResourceRecordSets.   Change Propagation to Amazon Route 53 DNS Servers  When you submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, Amazon Route 53 propagates your changes to all of the Amazon Route 53 authoritative DNS servers. While your changes are propagating, GetChange returns a status of PENDING. When propagation is complete, GetChange returns a status of INSYNC. Changes generally propagate to all Amazon Route 53 name servers within 60 seconds. For more information, see GetChange.

If you create a query logging configuration using the Amazon Route 53 console, Amazon Route 53 performs these operations automatically.    Create a CloudWatch Logs log group, and make note of the ARN, which you specify when you create a query logging configuration. Note the following:   You must create the log group in the us-east-1 region.   You must use the same AWS account to create the log group and the hosted zone that you want to configure query logging for.   When you create log groups for query logging, we recommend that you use a consistent prefix, for example:  /aws/route53/hosted zone name   In the next step, you'll create a resource policy, which controls access to one or more log groups and the associated AWS resources, such as Amazon Route 53 hosted zones. There's a limit on the number of resource policies that you can create, so we recommend that you use a consistent prefix so you can use the same resource policy for all the log groups that you create for query logging.     Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give it the permissions that Amazon Route 53 needs to create log streams and to send query logs to log streams. For the value of Resource, specify the ARN for the log group that you created in the previous step. To use the same resource policy for all the CloudWatch Logs log groups that you created for query logging configurations, replace the hosted zone name with *, for example:  arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/*   You can't use the CloudWatch console to create or edit a resource policy. You must use the CloudWatch API, one of the AWS SDKs, or the AWS CLI.     Log Streams and Edge Locations  When Amazon Route 53 finishes creating the configuration for DNS query logging, it does the following:   Creates a log stream for an edge location the first time that the edge location responds to DNS queries for the specified hosted zone. That log stream is used to log all queries that Amazon Route 53 responds to for that edge location.   Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream.   The name of each log stream is in the following format:   hosted zone ID/edge location code   The edge location code is a three-letter code and an arbitrarily assigned number, for example, DFW3. The three-letter code typically corresponds with the International Air Transport Association airport code for an airport near the edge location. (These abbreviations might change in the future.) For a list of edge locations, see "The Amazon Route 53 Global Network" on the Amazon Route 53 Product Details page.  Queries That Are Logged  Query logs contain only the queries that DNS resolvers forward to Amazon Route 53. If a DNS resolver has already cached the response to a query (such as the IP address for a load balancer for example.com), the resolver will continue to return the cached response. It doesn't forward another query to Amazon Route 53 until the TTL for the corresponding resource record set expires. Depending on how many DNS queries are submitted for a resource record set, and depending on the TTL for that resource record set, query logs might contain information about only one query out of every several thousand queries that are submitted to DNS.

For example, to create a hosted zone for exämple.com, you specify ex\344mple.com for the domain name. ListHostedZonesByName alphabetizes it as:  com.ex\344mple.  The labels are reversed and alphabetized using the escaped value. For more information about valid domain name formats, including internationalized domain names, see DNS Domain Name Format in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. Amazon Route 53 returns up to 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of hosted zones, use the MaxItems parameter to list them in groups of up to 100. The response includes values that help navigate from one group of MaxItems hosted zones to the next:   The DNSName and HostedZoneId elements in the response contain the values, if any, specified for the dnsname and hostedzoneid parameters in the request that produced the current response.   The MaxItems element in the response contains the value, if any, that you specified for the maxitems parameter in the request that produced the current response.   If the value of IsTruncated in the response is true, there are more hosted zones associated with the current AWS account.  If IsTruncated is false, this response includes the last hosted zone that is associated with the current account. The NextDNSName element and NextHostedZoneId elements are omitted from the response.

     *  Applies only to alias, failover alias, geolocation alias, latency alias, and weighted alias resource record sets: When EvaluateTargetHealth is true, an alias resource record set inherits the health of the referenced AWS resource, such as an ELB load balancer, or the referenced resource record set. Note the following:   You can't set EvaluateTargetHealth to true when the alias target is a CloudFront distribution.   If the AWS resource that you specify in AliasTarget is a resource record set or a group of resource record sets (for example, a group of weighted resource record sets), but it is not another alias resource record set, we recommend that you associate a health check with all of the resource record sets in the alias target. For more information, see What Happens When You Omit Health Checks? in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.   If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in HostedZoneId and DNSName, and if the environment contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one EC2 instance.) If you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true and either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 routes queries to other available resources that are healthy, if any. If the environment contains a single EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.   If you specify an ELB load balancer in  AliasTarget , ELB routes queries only to the healthy EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. If no EC2 instances are healthy or if the load balancer itself is unhealthy, and if EvaluateTargetHealth is true for the corresponding alias resource record set, Amazon Route 53 routes queries to other resources. When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for ELB health checks; they're not Amazon Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not create Amazon Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load balancer. For more information, see How Health Checks Work in More Complex Amazon Route 53 Configurations in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.   We recommend that you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true only when you have enough idle capacity to handle the failure of one or more endpoints.   For more information and examples, see Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Amazon Route 53 sends a DNS request to resolve the domain name that you specify in FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that you specify in RequestInterval. Using an IP address returned by DNS, Amazon Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint. Use one of the following formats for the value of IPAddress:     IPv4 address: four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example, 192.0.2.44.    IPv6 address: eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345. You can also shorten IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example, 2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345.   If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for IPAddress. This ensures that the IP address of your instance will never change. For more information, see HealthCheckConfig$FullyQualifiedDomainName. Constraints: Amazon Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses for which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:    RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses     RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space     RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses    When the value of Type is CALCULATED or CLOUDWATCH_METRIC, omit IPAddress.

If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.  If you specify HTTPS for the value of Type, the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or later.     HTTP_STR_MATCH: Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string that you specify in SearchString.    HTTPS_STR_MATCH: Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string that you specify in SearchString.

If the state of the alarm is OK, the health check is considered healthy. If the state is ALARM, the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have sufficient data to determine whether the state is OK or ALARM, the health check status depends on the setting for InsufficientDataHealthStatus: Healthy, Unhealthy, or LastKnownStatus.     CALCULATED: For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Amazon Route 53 adds up the number of health checks that Amazon Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy and compares that number with the value of HealthThreshold.

     * Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for IPAddress.  If you specify a value for IPAddress: Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks. When Amazon Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the Host header:   If you specify a value of 80 for Port and HTTP or HTTP_STR_MATCH for Type, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.    If you specify a value of 443 for Port and HTTPS or HTTPS_STR_MATCH for Type, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you specify another value for Port and any value except TCP for Type, Amazon Route 53 passes FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you don't specify a value for FullyQualifiedDomainName, Amazon Route 53 substitutes the value of IPAddress in the Host header in each of the preceding cases.  If you don't specify a value for IPAddress : Amazon Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that you specify for RequestInterval. Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns, Amazon Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.  If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Amazon Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName, the health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.  If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by FullyQualifiedDomainName, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).  In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the name of the resource record sets and you then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.  In addition, if the value that you specify for Type is HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP_STR_MATCH, or HTTPS_STR_MATCH, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header, as it does when you specify a value for IPAddress. If the value of Type is TCP, Amazon Route 53 doesn't pass a Host header.

Creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is not supported.  If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource. You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic location. The value * in the CountryCode element matches all geographic locations that aren't specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type elements.  Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven continents, Amazon Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of CountryCode is *, which handles both queries that come from locations for which you haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create a * resource record set, Amazon Route 53 returns a "no answer" response for queries from those locations.

     * If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in response to a DNS query only when a health check is passing, include the HealthCheckId element and specify the ID of the applicable health check. Amazon Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the following:   By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health check   By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health checks)   By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks)   For more information, see How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy. The HealthCheckId element is only useful when Amazon Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Amazon Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks only makes sense in the following configurations:   You're checking the health of the resource record sets in a group of weighted, latency, geolocation, or failover resource record sets, and you specify health check IDs for all of the resource record sets. If the health check for one resource record set specifies an endpoint that is not healthy, Amazon Route 53 stops responding to queries using the value for that resource record set.   You set EvaluateTargetHealth to true for the resource record sets in a group of alias, weighted alias, latency alias, geolocation alias, or failover alias resource record sets, and you specify health check IDs for all of the resource record sets that are referenced by the alias resource record sets.    Amazon Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint specified in the resource record set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the Value element. When you add a HealthCheckId element to a resource record set, Amazon Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the health check.   For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the United States, for North America, and for all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 checks the resource record sets for the United States, for North America, and for all locations (a resource record set for which the value of CountryCode is *), in that order, until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy.  If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (example.com).  n this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the name of the resource record sets and then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.

If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Amazon Route 53 sends a DNS request to resolve the domain name that you specify in FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that you specify in RequestInterval. Using an IP address that is returned by DNS, Amazon Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint. Use one of the following formats for the value of IPAddress:     IPv4 address: four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example, 192.0.2.44.    IPv6 address: eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345. You can also shorten IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example, 2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345.   If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for IPAddress. This ensures that the IP address of your instance never changes. For more information, see the applicable documentation:   Linux: Elastic IP Addresses (EIP) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances    Windows: Elastic IP Addresses (EIP) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Windows Instances     If a health check already has a value for IPAddress, you can change the value. However, you can't update an existing health check to add or remove the value of IPAddress.   For more information, see UpdateHealthCheckRequest$FullyQualifiedDomainName. Constraints: Amazon Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which the IP address is in local, private, non-routable, or multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses for which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:    RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses     RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space     RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses

     * Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for IPAddress.  If a health check already has a value for IPAddress, you can change the value. However, you can't update an existing health check to add or remove the value of IPAddress.    If you specify a value for IPAddress: Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks. When Amazon Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the Host header:   If you specify a value of 80 for Port and HTTP or HTTP_STR_MATCH for Type, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you specify a value of 443 for Port and HTTPS or HTTPS_STR_MATCH for Type, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you specify another value for Port and any value except TCP for Type, Amazon Route 53 passes  FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port  to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you don't specify a value for FullyQualifiedDomainName, Amazon Route 53 substitutes the value of IPAddress in the Host header in each of the above cases.  If you don't specify a value for IPAddress: If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Amazon Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify in FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval you specify in RequestInterval. Using an IPv4 address that is returned by DNS, Amazon Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.  If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Amazon Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName, the health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.  If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by FullyQualifiedDomainName, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).  In this configuration, if the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the name of the resource record sets and you then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.  In addition, if the value of Type is HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP_STR_MATCH, or HTTPS_STR_MATCH, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header, as it does when you specify a value for IPAddress. If the value of Type is TCP, Amazon Route 53 doesn't pass a Host header.
