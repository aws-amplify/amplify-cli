Specify this property to skip rolling back resources that AWS CloudFormation can't successfully roll back. We recommend that you  troubleshoot resources before skipping them.

For example, a failed resource update might cause dependent resources to fail. In this case, it might not be necessary to skip the dependent resources.  To skip resources that are part of nested stacks, use the following format: NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID.

To leave a parameter set to its present value, you can do one of the following:   Do not include the parameter in the list.   Include the parameter and specify UsePreviousValue as true. (You cannot specify both a value and set UsePreviousValue to true.)     To set all overridden parameter back to the values specified in the stack set, specify a parameter list but do not include any parameters.   To leave all parameters set to their present values, do not specify this property at all.   During stack set updates, any parameter values overridden for a stack instance are not updated, but retain their overridden value. You can only override the parameter values that are specified in the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself, use UpdateStackSet to update the stack set template. If you add a parameter to a template, before you can override the parameter value specified in the stack set you must first use UpdateStackSet to update all stack instances with the updated template and parameter value specified in the stack set. Once a stack instance has been updated with the new parameter, you can then override the parameter value using UpdateStackInstances.
