# This script is for promoting a CLI release candidate to @latest
# Usage: ./scripts/promote-rc.sh <hash> where <hash> is the same hash previously used to run `release-rc`.
# It is the hash in the release candidate version 1.2.3-rc.<hash>.0

# It will:
# pull the latest changes from the release candidate branch
# push HEAD~1 of the release candidate branch to the release branch.
#   HEAD~1 is used instead of HEAD so that the prerelease version commit is dropped from the latest release

# This will kick off a CCI workflow that will publish the @latest release
